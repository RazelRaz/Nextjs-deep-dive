# Next.js Deep Dive App

Welcome to the Next.js Deep Dive App! This is a comprehensive Next.js application that showcases the latest features and best practices of Next.js, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## Folder Structure

The app follows a well-organized folder structure to maintain code readability and reusability:

- **pages**: Contains the main pages of the application, with `page.jsx` serving as the Home page.
- **components**: Holds reusable UI components, including the app's navigation menu (`Menu.jsx`).
- **styles**: Includes `globals.css` for global styles and `page.module.css` for specific page styles.
- **about, blog, profile, product, and contact**: Represents different sections of the app, each containing a `page.js` file dynamically served by Next.js's App router.
- **product/brand**: Illustrates nested directories, with the `brand` folder having further category folders like `apple`.
- **product/brand/apple**: Contains two sub-category folders, `iphone` and `macbook`, showcasing a deeper nesting level.

## Layout and User Experience

The app provides a consistent and user-friendly layout with a progress bar implemented using the [next-nprogress-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-nprogress-bar) npm package. The progress bar enhances the user experience during navigation, providing visual feedback on page transitions.

## Key Features

- **App Router**: Utilizes Next.js's App router feature for smooth and dynamic page rendering based on the folder structure.
- **Reusable Components**: Promotes code reusability and maintainability with the `components` folder.
- **Nested Directory Concept**: Demonstrates efficient organization of complex app sections using nested directories.
- **Global and Page-Specific Styling**: Separates global styles from page-specific styles, ensuring a consistent yet flexible design.
- **Progress Bar**: Enhances user experience with a visual progress bar during page transitions.
